molecule

Contains a definition of Molecule in order to separate the internal
representation of the molecule from the QC program.

Classes
-------
Molecule
    Represents a molecule.

class Molecule :
    """
    Molecule
    
    Represents a molecule with the goal of separating the interface from the
    program used to parse it. It will have a name which will be used for things
    like naming directories for inputs.

    Attributes
    ----------
    __name: str
        The name of this molecule to be used to name files and the like.

    __geometry: list
        Specification of the geometry of the molecule. Each entry in the list
        will look like (atomic_symbol, atomic_num, mass, x, y, z).

    __charge: int
        The total charge on the molecule.

    __spin: int
        The spin multiplicity of the molecule.

    __meta
        Any metadata that you want to associate to this molecule.

    Methods
    -------
    __init__(self, name, geometry, charge, spin, meta = None)
        Constructor

    geometry
    spinstate
    charge
    metadata
        Getters for these values.

    __str__
        Returns the name.

    def __init__(self, name, geometry, charge = 0, spin = 1, meta = None) :
        """
        Molecule.__init__
        
        Initialize a molecule. Geometry should be a list where each element is
        of the form
        (atomic_symb, atomic_num, mass, x, y, z)
        The 'meta' parameter passes other data to store with this molecule.
        This allows for things like storing snapshot numbers or PES coordinates.

        Contributor: Connor Briggs

        Parameters
        ---------
        name
            The name of the molecule.

        geometry
            The geometry of the molecule. It should be in the form of
            (atomic_symb, atomic_number, mass, x, y, z), where atomic_symb is
            the atomic symbol of the atom at this point, atomic_number is the
            atomic number of the atom at this point, mass is the mass in
            atomic units at the point, and x, y, and z are the coordinates of
            the atom in Ã…ngstrom.

        charge
            The total charge on the molecule in electron charges.

        spin
            The spin multiplicity of the molecule.

        meta = None
            Any metadata that you want to associate with this molecule.
