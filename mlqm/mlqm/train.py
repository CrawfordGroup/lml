    '''
    Cluster `pts` into `M` clusters by the k-means algorithm

    Parameters
    ----------
    pts: list of initial data points
    M: int number of centers desired

    Returns
    -------
    maps: list of clusters containing `(point,number)` tuples
    where `number` is the location of `point` in `pts`

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm randomly selects M initial centers from `pts`. Then, 
    it iteratively re-clusters until convergence. The return is thus the 
    converged optimal mapping of the clusters (see `cluster` return).
