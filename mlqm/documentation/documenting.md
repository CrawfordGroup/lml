#Documenting MLQM: A rough guide.

When documenting your code, we have a few rules. Every program element must have a docstring associated with it outlining things like
what it does, who contributed to it, what makes it up, and what it expects. We use the [numpy standard](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) for our docstrings, and we ask that contributors use as many of the sections as possible when writing these docstrings.
