## Tutorials

These are generally Jupyter notebooks designed to walk the reader through various simple algorithms. I'm mostly writing these so that when I forget everything I have convenient notes to look back on; however, they may be useful to others. 

### Current tutorials:
* Linear regression with cross-validation
* * Fit a line by starting with a guess and minimizing a loss function through gradient descent, then use cross-validation to verify the results.
* Clustering with the k-means algorithm 
* * Use an unsupervised learning algorithm to group datapoints into clusters for further regression or classification.
* Gaussian process regression
* * Model an arbitrary polynomial curve by statistically regressing in a high-dimensional feature space with a set of coefficients spread across a chosen prior distribution.
* Machine-learning with Psi4
* * Generate a set of diatomic potential energy surface data with [psi4](github.com/psi4/psi4), then generate a model to predict additional points from geometric descriptors.
