Training a ml on multiple species at once, then predicting properties of another.

Combination schemes:
Monolithic data set: Pretty bad
Average of individual machines, weighted with variance of errors:
k-fold cross validation of the monolith:

Other things to try:
Use a classification algorithm to group similar species together, and then
predict the group of new species and use an ml better suited for its group.
