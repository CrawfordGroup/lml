# LML: Learning Machine Learning

I'm collecting a series of scripts and tutorials as I go through the tedious process of learning about machine learning. For now, this is very free-form, and each script or tutorial may have different dependencies. Generally `numpy` is necessary, and `scikit-learn` may also be used in some places. Machine-learning quantum mechanics (MLQM) scripts will generally use [`Psi4`](https://github.com/psi4/psi4) as a driver for generating test and validation data. (NOTE: [`mesp`](https://github.com/bgpeyton/mesp) may also be used during development of MLQM algorithms)
