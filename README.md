# LML: Learning Machine Learning

I'm collecting a series of scripts and tutorials as I go through the tedious process of learning about machine learning. For now, this is very free-form, and each script or tutorial may have different dependencies. Generally `numpy` is necessary, and `scikit-learn` may also be used in some places. Machine-learning quantum mechanics (MLQM) scripts generally will either use `Psi4` or `mesp` (same dependencies on `Psi4-Numpy`) as drivers for generating test and validation data.
